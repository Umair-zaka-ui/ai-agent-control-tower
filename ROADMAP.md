# AI Agent Control Tower — Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Backend MVP ✅

FastAPI + PostgreSQL control plane: agents, permissions, deterministic risk
scoring, allow/block/approval decisions, approval queue and immutable audit
logs. JWT auth.

## Phase 2 — Production-oriented platform ✅

Agent API-key auth, database-driven policy engine, advanced RBAC, approval
queue enhancements (priority/SLA/comments), email notifications, forensic
audit, dashboard APIs, risk engine v2 and Docker. 33 tests green.

## Phase 3 — Enterprise Dashboard UI 🚧

A modern React + TypeScript web interface (`frontend/`) consuming the Phase 1/2
APIs. Dark, enterprise design language (Azure / Datadog / Stripe / Linear feel).

### Part 1 — Scaffold & app shell ✅ (this branch)

- React 19 + TypeScript (strict) on Vite.
- TailwindCSS dark theme with the SRS palette as semantic tokens; Inter font.
- shadcn/ui primitives, Recharts, TanStack Query, Axios, React Router v7,
  React Hook Form + Zod, Lucide, Sonner, Framer Motion.
- Folder structure per SRS (components / layouts / pages / hooks / contexts /
  services / types / utils / constants / routes / config).
- Base dashboard layout: sidebar + top navigation, mobile-responsive.
- Auth layout + login page (RHF + Zod) wired to an Auth context; route guards.
- Service layer for every backend resource; typed domain models; data hooks.
- Coding standards documented; project builds and runs with `npm run dev`.

### Part 2 — Authentication & app shell ✅

- JWT login (React Hook Form + Zod) wired to the backend; token storage.
- Axios client attaches the token and redirects to `/login` on 401.
- `AuthContext`, `ProtectedRoute`/`PublicRoute`, sidebar + top navbar, logout.

### Part 3.1 — Live dashboard & data integration ✅

- Six KPI cards, agent-activity + 30-day risk-trend charts (Recharts, lazy),
  pending-approval queue (inline approve/reject), recent actions, recent audit
  logs and a system-health widget — all live from the backend.
- TanStack Query auto-refresh every 60s + manual refresh; skeleton/error/empty
  states; route-level code splitting for charts.
- New backend endpoints: `/dashboard/activity`, `/dashboard/risk-trend`,
  `/system/health`, plus `today_actions` on `/dashboard/summary`.
- Vitest unit/component tests added.

### Part 3.2a — Agent management module ✅

- Backend: agent metadata fields (owner, department, version, capabilities,
  risk config), ARCHIVED/BLOCKED statuses (migration 0003), paginated/searchable
  list, `PUT`/`DELETE`/`/stats` endpoints. Fixed a Part 3.1 timezone bug.
- Frontend `src/modules/agents/`: server-driven table (debounced search,
  filters, sort, pagination, CSV/JSON export, row actions), 5-step Create wizard
  with one-time API-key reveal, Details (Overview + live stats), Edit form,
  expandable sidebar group. Vitest tests added.

### Part 3.2b — Agent module, continued (planned)

- Activity timeline, API-key rotation/management, permission matrix, agent↔policy
  assignment (new join table), bulk actions, the remaining details tabs.

### Part 3.3 — Policy management module ✅

- Backend: policy lifecycle fields (priority, severity, status, trigger
  counters), `enable`/`disable`/`test`/`audit` endpoints and built-in policy
  templates (migration 0004). Org-scoped CRUD with RBAC + audit logging.
- Frontend `src/modules/policies/`: enterprise policy table (debounced search,
  status/decision/severity/resource filters, CSV export, row actions), 6-step
  policy builder with a JSON condition editor + live plain-English preview,
  Details page (Overview, Conditions, Audit timeline, Settings/danger zone),
  Edit form, Test/simulation panel and a template gallery. Role-based UI gating
  (ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN manage, REVIEWER tests, others view). Vitest tests added.

### Part 3.4 — Approval queue & human review workbench ✅

- Backend: enriched approval APIs — filterable queue (`GET /approvals`),
  statistics, full detail (agent/policy/risk/payload/comments), audit-derived
  timeline, plus `escalate`/`assign` actions, history and escalations boards
  (migration 0005 adds `assigned_to_user_id`/`escalation_target`/`escalated_at`,
  the `ESCALATED`/`EXPIRED` decision states and `approval.view`/`escalate`/
  `assign` RBAC codes). Org-scoped with RBAC + audit logging.
- Frontend `src/modules/approvals/`: statistics cards, filterable approval queue
  (debounced search, status/priority/risk filters, bulk approve, CSV export),
  approval details page, the review workbench (approve/reject/escalate/assign
  with validated dialogs + comment thread), recharts risk breakdown, decision
  timeline, history table and an escalations board with live SLA countdowns.
  Role-based UI gating (`approval.view/review/escalate/assign`). Vitest tests added.

### Part 3.5 — Enterprise Audit & Compliance Center ✅

- Backend: read-only, RBAC-gated audit views over the immutable `audit_logs`
  trail — enriched filterable table (`GET /audit`), statistics, recent-activity
  timeline, event-type catalog, per-event forensic detail (with related-event
  flow), a security dashboard, an informational compliance summary and an export
  feed. Severity/category/decision/status/actor are derived at read time
  (`audit_view`); no new columns. Adds the `audit.export` RBAC code and writes
  `AUTH_LOGIN`/`AUTH_LOGIN_FAILED` events on login.
- Frontend `src/modules/audit/`: audit dashboard (statistics cards, activity
  timeline, recent events), events explorer (debounced search + filters +
  server-side pagination), forensic event detail (request/response viewers +
  related-events graph), security & compliance dashboards, and an export center
  (CSV/JSON). Role-based UI gating (`audit.view` vs `audit.export`). Vitest tests
  added. See [`docs/phase-3-part-5.md`](docs/phase-3-part-5.md).

### Part 3.6 — Enterprise Analytics & AI Operations Center ✅

- Backend: read-only, RBAC-gated `/analytics/*` endpoints (overview, KPIs,
  activity, fleet-health, risk, performance, policies, review, cost, insights,
  reports) aggregating agents/agent_actions/approvals/policies/audit_logs. Real
  signals are computed; latency/cost figures are deterministic estimates
  (flagged). Adds `analytics.view` / `analytics.executive` / `analytics.operations`
  RBAC codes.
- Frontend `src/modules/analytics/`: executive overview (animated KPI grid, fleet
  health, activity chart, risk donut, insights), role-gated executive & operations
  (live feed) dashboards, risk (heatmap), performance (agent ranking), agents,
  policies, cost (estimated) dashboards, and a reports center with CSV/JSON export.
  Auto-refresh per SRS; role-based UI gating. Vitest tests added. See
  [`docs/phase-3-part-6.md`](docs/phase-3-part-6.md).

### Part 3.7+ — Remaining modules (planned)

- Per-agent policy scoping (agent↔policy assignment) and trigger history.
- Users & RBAC management; role-based navigation gating; e2e tests.

## Phase 4 — Enterprise Identity Platform

### Part 4.1 — Identity Foundation ✅

- Isolated `backend/app/identity` package (api → services → repositories →
  database). Reuses existing users/organizations/roles and adds the new identity
  entities: departments, teams, service_accounts, external_clients,
  agent_identities, sessions, refresh_tokens, device_sessions, security_events
  (migration `0006`), plus a nullable `users.department_id`.
- Domain models + lifecycle (Created→…→Deleted with validated transitions),
  repository layer (User/Role/Permission/Organization/Department/Session),
  `IdentityService`, security/permissions/roles/sessions/tokens/audit engines.
- Versioned `/api/v1/identity` API with a standard error envelope
  (`{success,error{code,message},request_id}`) and identity audit integration.
- Minimal frontend `src/modules/identity/` (directory at `/identity`) + unit +
  integration test scaffolding. See [`docs/phase-4-part-1.md`](docs/phase-4-part-1.md).

### Part 4.1a — Unified identity lifecycle ✅

- Migration `0007` adds `status` (`IdentityStatus`) to `users` and
  `organizations`, so **every** identity — human, AI agent, service account,
  organization, external client — shares one canonical lifecycle with validated,
  audited transitions (`transition_status`; humans keep `is_active` in sync).
- Agent identities, service accounts and external clients are now operable
  end-to-end (repositories + service + versioned API; client secrets shown once).
  Meets the Part 4.1 Definition of Done without caveats. Backend 80/80 green.

### Part 4.2.1 — Authentication architecture & trust model ✅

- Isolated `app/identity/auth` layer: the `IdentityContext` and the seven core
  services (Authentication/Token/RefreshToken/Credential/Session/SecurityEvent/
  IdentityContextResolver). Real login → refresh-with-rotation → reuse-detection
  → logout on the Part 4.1 session/refresh-token/security-event tables; short-
  lived (15 min) access tokens with the full claim set; an authentication
  middleware dependency (`authenticate`, JWT resolved; machine-key dispatch
  stubbed for 4.2.2).
- Auth enums (identity types, auth methods, security events), the §25 error
  codes, threat model, and a token-table migration plan (no schema change this
  part — additive tables land in 4.2.2/4.2.3). Design docs under
  [`docs/identity/`](docs/identity/). Backend 91/91 green.
- MFA/step-up assurance seam: `AuthAssuranceLevel` (AAL0/1/2), `amr` and
  `mfa_pending` on the context + token claims, `require_assurance` gate, and a
  challenge/`complete_mfa` path (verifier stubbed) so MFA is additive.

### Part 4.2.2.1 — Enterprise human authentication ✅

- `/api/v1/auth/*` endpoints on the 4.2.1 services: `login`, `refresh` (rotating),
  `logout`, `me`, `sessions` list + revoke, plus the `mfa/verify` seam.
- **argon2id** password hashing (legacy bcrypt verifies + auto-upgrades on login),
  the full password-complexity policy (`PasswordService`), and **account lockout**
  (5 failures / 15 min) driven by a new `login_history` table (migration `0008`).
- New error codes (`ACCOUNT_LOCKED`, …) + the `AUTH_LOGIN_LOCKED` event.
- Frontend: refresh-token storage, **silent refresh** (5 min pre-expiry), an axios
  401→refresh→retry interceptor and a `SessionExpiredModal`. Docs:
  [`docs/identity/human-authentication.md`](docs/identity/human-authentication.md).
  Backend 112/112 green; frontend typecheck + lint clean.

### Part 4.2.2.2 — Login, logout & session lifecycle ✅

The session — not the JWT — is now the source of truth. `authenticate` loads and
revalidates `auth_sessions` on **every** authenticated request, so logout, admin
force-logout, device block, idle timeout (30 min), absolute timeout (12 h) and
refresh-token-reuse termination all take effect immediately. This closes the
access-token revocation gap that ADR-0003 knowingly accepted; see
[ADR-0007](docs/architecture/adr/0007-stateful-session-validation.md).

- `auth_sessions` (states, dual deadlines, device, geo, security score) and
  `auth_devices` (fingerprint, trust posture); refresh-token **families** with
  `family_id` + `reuse_detected_at`. Migration `0009`, downgrade round-tripped.
- Four services: `SessionLifecycleService`, `SessionSecurityService`,
  `DeviceService`, `RefreshRotationService`.
- Concurrent sessions (max 5, oldest evicted), "remember me" (extends the
  *absolute* ceiling only), sliding idle window with a throttled activity write.
- Suspending or disabling an identity now revokes its live sessions
  (`ACCOUNT_DISABLED`) — previously they survived to the 12-hour ceiling.
- Endpoints: session list/detail/revoke, logout-all, device list/trust/block.
- **Administrative** session management (`session.view` / `session.revoke`,
  migration `0010`): an admin can list, inspect and force-logout any session in
  their organization, or sign a user out of every device — with the acting
  administrator recorded on the audit event. Cross-tenant access returns 404.
- All twelve SRS §26 audit events are emitted (timeouts, `SESSION_SUSPICIOUS` and
  the `IDLE`→`ACTIVE` transition were previously defined but never fired); a test
  greps the sources so an event type cannot become dead code again.
- Frontend: Settings → Security → Sessions & Devices, with confirm-before-revoke.
- **Auditable**: `security_events` gained a read path (per-org stream, per-identity
  timeline, per-session history) plus the indexes to serve it (migration `0011`). It was
  a write-only table — an audit event nobody can read is not an audit trail. Gated on
  `session.view`, *not* `audit.view`, which every role including `VIEWER` holds.
- Session/device audit UI: a user sees their own security activity; an admin sees any
  member's, and one session's full history ("who revoked it, when, and why?").
- Fixed a platform-wide defect found while verifying: the SPA's `/api/v1/auth` token was
  rejected by the legacy decoder (`Invalid audience`), so **every dashboard request 401'd**
  for real users. Both auth dependencies now accept it *and* revalidate its session, so
  revocation is immediate platform-wide rather than only on `/api/v1/auth`.
- Docs: [session-lifecycle](docs/identity/session-lifecycle.md),
  [token-rotation](docs/identity/token-rotation.md),
  [device-management](docs/identity/device-management.md),
  [security-events](docs/identity/security-events.md).
  Backend 187/187 green; frontend 123/123 green; typecheck + build clean.

### Part 4.2.2.3.1 — Enterprise registration & invitations ✅

Authentication is only half of identity. This part answers the other half: how a human
becomes a trusted identity. The enterprise default is **invitation only** — every
existing organization was migrated to `INVITE_ONLY`, because an upgrade must never
silently open public registration.

- Full lifecycle `INVITED → REGISTERED → EMAIL_PENDING → EMAIL_VERIFIED → ACTIVE`, each
  state persisted and observable. `REGISTERED` is where a user sits when SMTP fails —
  the state an operator needs to see, and what `resend-verification` retries from.
- `invitations`, `email_verifications`, `user_profiles`, `rate_limit_hits`
  (migration `0012`, downgrade round-tripped). One live invitation per (org, email),
  enforced by a **partial** unique index on PENDING rows.
- Tokens: 32 bytes of CSPRNG, SHA-256 at rest, single use, expiring (7 d / 24 h).
  Resend **rotates** — otherwise "single use" quietly becomes "N uses".
- Five services: Registration, Invitation, EmailVerification, UserProvisioning,
  RegistrationAudit. `UserProvisioningService` is the seam SSO and SCIM will use.
- **Rate limiting** (the platform's first): 5 req/min/IP on every public endpoint,
  Postgres-backed because ADR-0002 forbids a second datastore. Fixed window, and the
  docs say so.
- Enumeration-safe: `resend-verification` answers identically for unknown, pending and
  already-verified addresses.
- The login gate now says *why*: `EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED` and `ACCOUNT_PENDING_APPROVAL`
  instead of a useless "this identity is not permitted to authenticate".
- Frontend: accept-invitation, verify-email, register, invitation-expired and
  registration-success pages, plus an admin **Invitations** panel — reachable, not just
  built. Password-strength meter mirrors the server policy without becoming a second gate.
- `notification_service.send_email` now reports delivery instead of swallowing failures,
  which is what makes `REGISTERED` vs `EMAIL_PENDING` mean anything.
- Docs: [registration](docs/identity/registration.md), [invitations](docs/identity/invitations.md),
  [email-verification](docs/identity/email-verification.md).
  Backend 230/230 green; frontend 174/174 green.

### Part 4.2.2.3.2 — Enterprise password policy & credential management ✅

The full credential lifecycle on top of argon2id: a single-source policy (length,
character classes, common-password blocklist, keyboard/number sequences, repeats, and
your own name/email/org), **password history** (no reuse of the last 10), **90-day
expiration** with in-app warnings, **administrative reset** issuing a one-time temporary
password, and a **mandatory first-login change** the app cannot be skipped past.

- `password_history` table + `users` lifecycle columns (`password_changed_at`,
  `password_expires_at`, `must_change_password`); migration `0013`.
- One write path (`CredentialService`): verify current → min-age → complexity → no-reuse
  → argon2id → history → stamp → audit → revoke other sessions.
- Endpoints: change-password, admin/reset-password, validate-password, password-policy,
  password-expiration, and the org password dashboard. 9 audit events, reachability-grepped.
- Deviations documented: reused `users.password_hash` + `security_events` rather than the
  SRS's separate credential/policy/temp/event tables. Enforcement boundary (UI/session,
  not per-endpoint) documented as a known limitation.
- Docs: [password-policy](docs/identity/password-policy.md),
  [credential-management](docs/identity/credential-management.md),
  [password-history](docs/identity/password-history.md).

### Part 4.2.2.3.3 — Password reset, account recovery & email change ✅

Enterprise recovery that reuses the platform's discipline rather than a weaker parallel.

- **Forgot password**: `rst_` tokens (256-bit, SHA-256, single-use, 30 min), a
  non-enumerating uniform response (identical for known/unknown and even on error).
- **Reset** runs the full credential write path and **revokes every session** (§13);
  dead links are 410 and say which kind of dead.
- **Verified email change**: confirm the new address before it takes effect
  (`pending_email`); alert the old mailbox on completion.
- `password_reset_requests` table + `email_verifications.purpose/new_email`; migration
  `0014`. Rate limited; recovery-events dashboard (`recovery.view`). 9 audit events.
- Docs: [password-reset](docs/identity/password-reset.md), [recovery](docs/identity/recovery.md).

### Part 4.2.2.3.4 — Account protection & risk-based authentication ✅

Authentication becomes non-binary: every login is scored and the score plus admin rules
decide allow / challenge / MFA / lock / block.

- **Risk scoring** (0–100) from signals — new device/country, impossible travel, failed
  attempts, suspicious agent, blocked IP — with a first-login baseline guard so new
  accounts are not flagged.
- **Progressive lockout** (15m → 30m → 1h → 24h → security review) on a stateful
  `account_locks` table; **brute-force & credential-stuffing** detection per
  account/IP/target-set; **blocked IPs** refused before the password; **protection rules**
  (`conditions → decision`), **adaptive rate limits**, and a **CAPTCHA** seam.
- New tables `account_locks`, `identity_risk_events`, `blocked_ips`,
  `identity_protection_rules`; `login_history` extended with the risk columns; migration
  `0015`. Generic login errors preserved (no enumeration, no signal leak).
- Security console (Settings → Security → Account protection): dashboard, login attempts,
  risk events, locks with audited unlock, blocked IPs, rules. 14 audit events,
  reachability-grepped.
- Docs: [account-protection](docs/security/account-protection.md),
  [risk-based-authentication](docs/security/risk-based-authentication.md),
  [brute-force-protection](docs/security/brute-force-protection.md),
  [account-lockout](docs/security/account-lockout.md),
  [identity-protection-rules](docs/security/identity-protection-rules.md).
  Backend 338/338 green.

### Part 4.2.2.3.5 — Backend APIs, integration & release (Phase 4.2.2 close-out) ✅

The consolidation pass over the whole Enterprise Human Authentication subsystem
(4.2.2.1 → 4.2.2.3.4): verify the §4 API contract end-to-end, close the cross-cutting
HTTP-layer gaps, and record the release contract honestly.

- **HTTP hardening**: `RequestContextMiddleware` stamps every request/response with a
  correlation id (`X-Request-ID`, generated when absent) that flows into the error
  envelope (§15); `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` applies `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `X-Frame-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, a deny-by-default `Content-Security-Policy`,
  `Permissions-Policy` and opt-in HSTS to every response, errors included (§16, §23).
- **Standard response envelope (§5)**: `ResponseEnvelopeMiddleware` wraps every 2xx JSON
  response under `/api` as `{success, data, meta:{request_id, timestamp}}` (errors already
  carry a matching envelope); the SPA unwraps it centrally so no service code changed.
  `/health`, `/openapi.json` and file exports are left untouched.
- **Full-stack deployment (§24)**: `frontend/Dockerfile` (Vite build → nginx serving the
  SPA and reverse-proxying `/api`) + `web` service in `docker-compose.yml` (web + api + db,
  same-origin), with a release checklist in [deployment](docs/deployment.md).
- **Contract verified**: every §4 capability is implemented; the only remaining deviation
  is stable path placement (invitation/password/admin routes under `/identity` &
  `/security`). No unreachable `logout-all` / `device-delete` stubs.
- New `app/core/middleware.py`; `SECURITY_*` + `REQUEST_ID_HEADER` +
  `RESPONSE_ENVELOPE_ENABLED` settings; 11 new tests. Backend **352/352** green; frontend
  tsc + build clean; web Docker image builds.
- Docs: [http-conventions](docs/api/http-conventions.md), [testing](docs/testing/strategy.md),
  [deployment](docs/deployment.md), `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Phase 4.3 — Enterprise Authorization Platform 🚧

RBAC + ABAC + policy engine: centralized, auditable authorization for every request.

### Part 4.3.1 — Enterprise RBAC foundation ✅

Turns the flat Phase-1 RBAC into an enterprise foundation **by extension, not
replacement** — the existing `roles`/`rbac_permissions`/`user_roles` tables gain columns
and everything that already resolves permissions keeps working.

- **Roles** gain category (SYSTEM/CUSTOM/ORGANIZATION/PROJECT/RESOURCE), lifecycle status,
  `priority` (conflict resolution), `is_assignable` and audit columns; **permissions**
  gain a domain **group**, `resource_type`/`action` split and `is_system`.
- **Scoped assignments**: `user_roles` carries scope + org/department/team/project/
  resource targets and `expires_at` (time-boxed). **Role hierarchy** (`role_hierarchy`):
  a senior role inherits its descendants' permissions, kept acyclic by cycle detection.
- **18 built-in roles** (Platform / AI Ops / Organization / read-only) seeded globally
  with priorities + hierarchy, alongside the legacy four. **Authorization audit** table
  records every change and (from 4.3.2) every decision.
- New `app/authorization/` package (enums, catalog, repositories, services, schemas,
  routes) + migration `0016`; 15+ endpoints under `/api/v1` (`roles`, `permissions`,
  `permission-groups`, `role-assignments`, `role-hierarchy`, `authorization/audit`),
  permission-gated (`role.view`/`role.manage`/`role.assign`).
- Admin portal (Settings → Security → Authorization): Roles, Permissions, Permission
  groups, Assignments, Hierarchy, Audit. Backend **383** green (31 new); frontend **221**
  green (4 new); tsc + build clean.
- Docs: [rbac](docs/authorization/rbac.md), [roles](docs/authorization/roles.md),
  [permissions](docs/authorization/permissions.md),
  [role-hierarchy](docs/authorization/role-hierarchy.md).

### Part 4.3.2 — Enterprise Permission Engine ✅

Every authorization decision now flows through one centralized, cached engine — no
controller branches on role names.

- **Engine** (`app/authorization/engine.py`): small pure resolvers — Role (assigned +
  inherited via hierarchy), Permission (grant list = legacy fallback + scoped role
  grants), **Wildcard** (`resource.*` and the reserved global `*`), **Scope**
  (global→resource), **Conflict** (**explicit deny wins**, else allow, else default deny).
  Returns a structured `{allowed, reason, scope, source_role}`.
- **Cache**: resolved grants cached per identity in `permission_cache`, tagged with a
  per-org `permission_versions` counter; any role/permission/assignment change bumps the
  version and invalidates immediately (Postgres, ADR-0002). `role_permissions.effect`
  adds explicit DENY grants. Migration `0017`.
- **Centralization**: `require_permission` gates through the engine platform-wide (all
  408 existing checks unchanged — a faithful superset); `POST /api/v1/authorization/check`
  evaluates the caller's access with `evaluation_time_ms` + `cache_hit`; decisions are
  audited to `authorization_decisions` (denials always; allows opt-in).
- **Frontend**: `PermissionProvider`, `usePermissions`/`useCan`, `ProtectedComponent` /
  `RequirePermission` — wildcard-aware, server remains source of truth.
- Docs: [permission-engine](docs/authorization/permission-engine.md),
  [permission-resolution](docs/authorization/permission-resolution.md),
  [wildcards](docs/authorization/wildcards.md), [scopes](docs/authorization/scopes.md),
  [caching](docs/authorization/caching.md). Backend **408** green (25 new); frontend
  **232** green (8 new); tsc + build clean.

Next: 4.3.5 ABAC, 4.3.6 middleware, 4.3.7 portal, 4.3.8 production readiness.

### Part 4.3.3 — Enterprise organization hierarchy ✅

Authorization is now evaluated within the full enterprise structure — Platform →
Organization → Business Unit → Department → Team → Project → Resources — extending the
existing `organizations`/`departments`/`teams` in place.

- **Schema** (migration `0018`): new `business_units`, `projects`, `resource_ownership`,
  `delegations`; `organizations` +slug/owner, `departments` +business_unit/status,
  `teams` +status.
- **Services**: entity CRUD (org/BU/dept/team/project) with parent validation and
  child-deletion guards; `HierarchyResolverService` (parent chain / descendants / path);
  `ResourceOwnershipService` (assign/transfer/resolve); `OrganizationHierarchyService`
  (tree); `DelegationService` (delegate/revoke with boundary enforcement).
- **Engine integration (§14)**: a resource's ownership path is resolved into the check's
  `ResourceContext`, so a scoped grant applies via **downward inheritance**; **cross-org
  isolation (§9)** denies foreign-org resources unless the caller holds `*` or a delegation.
- 20+ `/api/v1` endpoints (organizations, business-units, departments, teams, projects,
  hierarchy/tree, resource-ownership, delegations) gated `organization.view`/`.manage`;
  10 audit events; new error codes (`CROSS_ORG_FORBIDDEN`, `ENTITY_HAS_CHILDREN`,
  `DELEGATION_EXCEEDS_AUTHORITY`, …).
- Admin portal (Settings → Security → Organization): Hierarchy explorer (searchable tree),
  Business units, Departments, Teams, Projects, Delegation. Backend **421** green (8 new);
  frontend **235** green (3 new).
- Docs: [organization-hierarchy](docs/authorization/organization-hierarchy.md),
  [hierarchy-resolution](docs/authorization/hierarchy-resolution.md),
  [resource-ownership](docs/authorization/resource-ownership.md),
  [delegated-administration](docs/authorization/delegated-administration.md).

### Part 4.3.4 — Enterprise resource-based authorization (RBAC + Resource ACL) ✅

Every managed object is now a first-class protected resource; access decisions layer
ownership, ACLs, delegation, sharing, visibility and resource policy over the role
decision — users with identical roles get different answers per resource.

- **Schema** (migration `0019`): `resources` (registry: owner + owner_type, visibility,
  status, JSONB policy), `resource_acl` (per-principal ALLOW/DENY with expiry),
  `resource_shares` (READ→MANAGE with expiry), `ownership_history` (transfers preserved),
  `resource_delegations` (time-boxed, revocable).
- **Services** (`app/authorization/resources/`): `ResourceAuthorizationService` runs the
  §5/§18 chain — identity → org scope → roles → **explicit deny** → policy → ownership →
  ACL allow → delegation → sharing → role allow → visibility → **default deny**;
  plus registry, ACL, sharing, ownership(+history), delegation, policy services and a
  `MembershipResolver` (user/role/team/department/org principals).
- **Engine integration (§18)**: `POST /api/v1/authorization/check` routes *registered*
  resources through the full resource chain; unregistered resources keep the 4.3.2/4.3.3
  path. Owners cannot bypass global denies; a DENY never binds a platform admin on
  SYSTEM resources (§22).
- 20 `/api/v1/resources` endpoints (registry, owner/transfer-ownership/history, acl,
  share, delegate, policy, authorize with identity simulation); 14 audit events
  (`RESOURCE_SHARED`, `RESOURCE_OWNER_CHANGED`, `RESOURCE_ACL_*`, `RESOURCE_DELEGATED`,
  `RESOURCE_ACCESS_GRANTED/DENIED`, …); 9 error codes (`RESOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED`,
  `OWNER_TRANSFER_NOT_ALLOWED`, `CROSS_ORGANIZATION_ACCESS_DENIED`, `DELEGATION_EXPIRED`,
  …); permissions `resource.view` / `resource.manage`.
- Admin portal (Settings → Security → Resources): Resource permissions (registry +
  visibility), ACL (search/filter, effect toggle), Sharing, Ownership transfer (+history),
  Delegation, and the **Authorization Inspector** (simulate identity × resource ×
  permission → ALLOW/DENY with reason, source, owner, visibility, steps).
- Docs: [resource-authorization](docs/authorization/resource-authorization.md),

### Part 4.3.5 — Attribute-Based Access Control engine (ABAC) ✅

Authorization is now **context-aware**: after RBAC, the org hierarchy and the resource
chain say *allow*, the ABAC engine decides whether the action is safe **right now** —
considering identity, resource sensitivity (PII/PHI), action, environment (network zone,
device trust, business hours, risk score) and AI-specific attributes (autonomy level,
model, tool risk). ABAC can never grant what the baseline denied.

- **Schema** (migration `0020`): `abac_policies` (versioned + lifecycle DRAFT →
  VALIDATED → ACTIVE → DISABLED/DEPRECATED/ARCHIVED; NULL org = platform policy),
  `abac_policy_versions` (immutable snapshots), `attribute_definitions` (the registry —
  only registered attributes may be used), `abac_evaluations`, `abac_policy_exceptions`
  (time-boxed, auto-expiring).
- **Engine** (`app/authorization/abac/`): five attribute providers
  (subject/resource/action/environment/AI) → normalized context; 16 safe operators
  (typed, ReDoS-guarded, no dynamic code); nested ALL/ANY/NOT condition trees with
  per-condition traces; scope + target policy resolution (org hierarchy aware, per-org
  cached); five combining algorithms (default `DENY_OVERRIDES`: deny → approval → MFA →
  justification → mask/limit → allow); obligations (CREATE_APPROVAL, REQUIRE_MFA,
  REQUIRE_JUSTIFICATION, MASK_FIELDS, LIMIT_ACTION, LOG_ONLY); explainable decisions
  with RESTRICTED values redacted; §43 metrics.
- **Integration (§25)**: `POST /api/v1/authorization/check` runs RBAC → org scope →
  resource chain → ABAC and returns one normalized decision (`decision` +
  `obligations`); baseline deny is final; no applicable policy → baseline stands;
  callers can never spoof `identity.*` attributes.
- 26 `/api/v1/authorization` endpoints: policy CRUD + validate/publish/disable/archive/
  clone, versions + rollback, read-only simulation (stack-wide & single-policy),
  evaluate, evaluation log, metrics, attribute catalog, exceptions. 10 permissions
  (author/publisher separable), 17 audit events, 13 error codes.
- Admin portal (Settings → Security → Context policies): policy list/details/versions,
  **visual policy builder** (nested condition groups, typed values, human-readable
  preview, raw JSON), **Policy Simulator** (never executes the action), attribute
  catalog, evaluation viewer, exceptions.

Next: 4.3.6 authorization middleware, 4.3.7 admin portal, 4.3.8 production readiness.

### Part 4.3.6 — Enterprise authorization middleware & enforcement architecture ✅

Every protected operation now flows through **one enforcement pipeline** — REST
routes, the explicit check endpoint, background workers, scheduled jobs, workflow
nodes, the AI agent runtime and API-key integrations. No controller, service, agent
or job performs independent authorization checks.

- **Gateway** (`app/authorization/middleware/`): `AuthorizationGateway.authorize /
  authorize_background / authorize_agent` coordinates RBAC, org hierarchy, resource
  authorization, ABAC, obligations, audit, caching and metrics behind one call and
  returns one normalized decision (§17) with a stage-by-stage pipeline trace (§18).
  The ten-stage order (§9) is pinned and order-enforced. Baseline deny is final;
  ABAC errors fail closed.
- **Context** (§5): immutable `AuthorizationContext` (frozen dataclass, read-only
  mappings, append-only trace) built only by the `AuthorizationContextBuilder`;
  caller attributes can never spoof `identity.*`.
- **Decision cache** (§19, §23): identity × permission × resource × org ×
  RBAC-version × ABAC-generation keys + TTL + per-identity epoch — role changes,
  policy changes, org changes and session revocation invalidate instantly;
  challenges and dynamic contexts are never cached. Warm path <5ms.
- **Enforcement** (§27–§31): `require_permission` runs the pipeline on every route
  (challenges → typed errors `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` / `MFA_REQUIRED` /
  `JUSTIFICATION_REQUIRED`, the latter satisfiable in-band via `X-Justification`;
  constraints ride on `request.state.authorization`); the agent runtime layers ABAC
  over the Phase-2 governance baseline (deny → BLOCK, approval → the human-review
  queue); workers/schedulers/workflow nodes use `authorize_background`.
- **Obligations** (§16): approval routing, MFA, justification, recursive field
  masking, parameter clamping (rows/tokens/cost/export), security notification,
  LOG_ONLY — obligations modify execution, never replace authorization.
- **Audit & observability** (§24, §34, §35): six pipeline events incl.
  `DECISION_GENERATED` (with the full trace) and `EXECUTION_COMPLETED`;
  `GET /api/v1/authorization/middleware/metrics` (requests, denies, challenges,
  latency avg/p95, cache hit ratio, pipeline errors).
- **Frontend** (§32, §33): `AuthorizationProvider` (decision/error → dialog
  routing), `ApprovalRequiredDialog`, `MFAChallenge`, `ObligationDialog`,
  `AuthorizationErrorBoundary`, `PermissionGuard`, `useAuthorize`,
  `decisionToUi` / `maskFields` / `actionLimits`.
- Also fixed a concurrent get-or-create race in the permission-version bootstrap.

  [pipeline](docs/authorization/pipeline.md),

  Backend **518** green (47 new: 21 unit, 22 integration/security, 4 perf);
  frontend **259** green (10 new); tsc + build clean.

Next: 4.3.7 authorization admin portal, 4.3.8 production readiness.

### Part 4.3.7 — Enterprise authorization administration portal ✅

One web control plane for the whole authorization platform. The portal unifies
the 4.3.1–4.3.6 surfaces (roles, hierarchy, resources, ABAC builder/simulator,
audit) behind a permission-aware navigation and adds the operational pages that
were missing: dashboard, decision explorer, access reviews and analytics.

- **Admin API** (`app/authorization/admin/`, §18): 20 `/api/v1/admin` endpoints
  delegating to the existing phase services — dashboard, roles CRUD, permission
  catalog, organization tree, resource registry, ABAC policy CRUD, policy
  simulator (audited `SIMULATION_EXECUTED`, read-only), decision explorer,
  access reviews, analytics. Gated by 10 new separable `admin.*` permissions
  (§21); enforced through the 4.3.6 gateway like every route.
- **Dashboard** (§6): 12 widgets + 5 charts, tenant-scoped, <2 s (§24, tested).
- **Access reviews** (§14; migration `0021`): DRAFT → SCHEDULED → ACTIVE →
  COMPLETED → ARCHIVED; activation snapshots in-scope role assignments;
  certify/revoke per item with comments — **revoke removes the live assignment**
  via the RBAC service; completion blocked while items are pending; JSON report
  export; 6 audit events; lifecycle guards return 409.
- **Decision explorer** (§13): filterable tenant-isolated decision history with
  reasons/scope/latency/request-id detail; every view audited
  (`DECISION_VIEWED`).
- **Security analytics** (§17): denied trends, high-risk decisions, MFA and
  approval rates, latency avg/p95, cache performance, ABAC deny/challenge
  counters, top denied permissions, sharing trends.
- **Frontend** (`modules/admin`): AdminDashboardPage, DecisionExplorerPage,
  AccessReviewsPage, SecurityAnalyticsPage + `AdminNav` (§5 navigation across
  every authorization surface, permission-filtered); `/admin/*` routes; portal
  card in Settings → Security.
- Docs: [dashboard](docs/admin/dashboard.md), [roles](docs/admin/roles.md),

  Backend **530** green (12 new); frontend **267** green (8 new); tsc + build
  clean.

Next: 4.3.8 Identity Governance & Administration.

### Part 4.3.8 — Identity Governance & Administration (IGA) ✅

Extends the authorization platform with continuous governance: SoD/toxic
permission detection, privileged access review, orphaned-identity detection,
risk scoring, automated remediation and compliance reporting, over the
existing 4.3.1–4.3.7 authorization/certification foundation.

- **Governance API** (`app/governance/`, §19): 40 `/api/v1/governance`
  endpoints. Certification campaigns (§5-§7) are a thin proxy over the 4.3.7
  `AccessReviewService` — same engine, extended with `campaign_type` and
  MODIFIED/DELEGATED decisions — everything else is new. Gated by 11 new
  `governance.*` permissions (§18); new builtin `ROLE_COMPLIANCE_ADMIN`.
- **SoD / toxic permission detection** (§9, §10; migration `0022`): one
  `sod_rules` engine (`rule_type=SOD|TOXIC_PERMISSION`) — an identity trips a
  rule when its effective permissions (role hierarchy resolved) intersect
  both of the rule's permission sets. Detection is continuous: an org-wide
  scan endpoint, plus a best-effort scan on every `POST /role-assignments`.
- **Privileged access governance** (§11): lists identities holding a tracked
  privileged role with a live risk score and last activity; review/approve/
  revoke workflow — revoke removes the grant through the RBAC service.
- **Orphaned identity detection** (§12): disabled-but-still-granted users,
  90-day-inactive users, stale API keys, unused roles — deduplicated findings.
- **Governance risk scoring** (§13): 0-100 score from five weighted factors
  (privileged roles, open toxic/SoD findings, inactivity, failed
  certifications, outstanding approvals) → LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL band.
- **Remediation** (§14): typed actions against a finding; REMOVE_ROLE/
  DISABLE_ACCOUNT/DISABLE_API_KEY/EXPIRE_DELEGATION execute against live
  state; NOTIFY_MANAGER/CREATE_APPROVAL_REQUEST/REQUIRE_MFA/
  CREATE_SECURITY_TICKET are audit-tracked hooks (no manager hierarchy,
  ticketing, or per-user MFA-required flag exists yet to wire into).
- **Compliance reporting** (§15, §16): SOC 2/ISO 27001/HIPAA/GDPR/NIST/CIS/
  Internal control → evidence mapping; immutable evidence snapshots; JSON/CSV
  export (PDF/Excel via client-side conversion, matching the existing export
  pattern elsewhere in this app).
- **Governance dashboard + analytics** (§21, §26): 10 widgets, 5 charts,
  computed live (no caching layer yet).
- **Frontend** (`modules/governance`): 12 pages + `GovernanceNav`
  (permission-filtered, mirrors `AdminNav`); `/governance/*` routes; linked
  from `AdminNav` and the Settings → Security governance card.
- Docs: [governance-dashboard](docs/governance/governance-dashboard.md),
  [access-certification](docs/governance/access-certification.md),
  [sod-analysis](docs/governance/sod-analysis.md),
  [toxic-permissions](docs/governance/toxic-permissions.md),

  [orphaned-identities](docs/governance/orphaned-identities.md),
  [risk-scoring](docs/governance/risk-scoring.md),
  [remediation](docs/governance/remediation.md),
  [compliance-reporting](docs/governance/compliance-reporting.md).
  Backend **544** green (14 new); frontend **267** green, tsc + build clean;
  verified end-to-end in a real browser (registration → login → create/
  activate an SoD rule → create/launch/review a certification campaign).

Next: 5.0 Agent Runtime & Lifecycle Management.

### Part 5.0 — Agent Runtime & Lifecycle Management ✅

The execution layer: register, version, deploy and execute real AI agents
under the same governance and security controls as the rest of the
platform, over the existing agent registry and authorization gateway.

- **Agent registry** (migration `0023`): additive columns on the existing
  Phase 1 `agents` table (`slug`, `project_id`, `owner_type`/`owner_id`,
  `criticality`, `data_classification`, `default_environment`,
  `lifecycle_status`, `archived_at`) — no parallel registry. New
  `agent_definitions` table; DRAFT → VALIDATED → APPROVED → ACTIVE →
  SUSPENDED/DEPRECATED/ARCHIVED/RETIRED lifecycle.
- **Immutable versioning** (`agent_versions`): checksummed snapshots
  (config, prompt, model config, capability/tool refs, policy);
  DRAFT → READY_FOR_REVIEW → APPROVED → PUBLISHED → DEPRECATED/REVOKED;
  publish recomputes the checksum and blocks on tamper.
- **Deployments** (`agent_deployments`): DEVELOPMENT/TEST/STAGING/
  PRODUCTION/SANDBOX; RECREATE strategy (CANARY/ROLLING/BLUE_GREEN modeled,
  not yet executed); mission-critical + production deployments gate on
  approval; rollback to any prior published/deprecated version.
- **Runtime Gateway** (`app/runtime/services.py::ExecutionRequestService`):
  the only entry point for execution — agent/deployment/version state →
  idempotency (`idempotency_records`) → the existing 4.3.6
  `AuthorizationGateway` (RBAC/ABAC) → runtime policy (concurrency limits,
  approved models, environment restrictions) → approval → queue. Denials
  and policy blocks are saved as inspectable execution rows, not thrown.
- **Postgres-backed queue & worker** (`agent_executions` +
  `execution_locks`, no Redis/Celery): `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
  claim, per-attempt retry with a non-retryable error allowlist, dead-
  lettering after `maximum_retries`. Driven inline/eagerly in this
  environment (see [docs/runtime/workers-and-queue.md](docs/runtime/workers-and-queue.md)).
- **Capabilities & tools** (`capabilities`/`agent_capabilities`,
  `tools`/`agent_tools`/`tool_calls`): declare-then-assign-then-authorize;
  the Tool Gateway default-denies everything except the built-in
  `FUNCTION`/`echo` action (no outbound network/code-execution surface in
  this build).
- **Model Gateway**: provider-neutral contract; only `MOCK` is a working
  adapter (deterministic, no network call); any other provider fails
  closed with `MODEL_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`.
- **Runtime approvals** (`runtime_approvals`, new — the existing
  `Approval` model is 1:1 with `agent_action_id` and doesn't fit): gates
  mission-critical/production deployments and executions.
- **Kill switch**: execution/agent/organization scope, always audited,
  always reason-required and confirmed in the UI.
- Gated by 32 new `runtime.*` permissions; new builtin roles
  `ROLE_RUNTIME_ADMIN` (full control) and `ROLE_RUNTIME_OPERATOR`
  (register/version/run, no publish/kill-switch).
- **Frontend** (`modules/runtime`): 11 pages + `RuntimeNav`
  (permission-filtered, mirrors `GovernanceNav`); `/runtime/*` routes;
  linked from `AdminNav`.
- Docs: [docs/runtime/](docs/runtime/) — overview, architecture,
  agent-lifecycle, versioning, deployments, executions, workers-and-queue,
  capabilities-and-tools, gateways, runtime-policy-and-approvals,
  health-and-observability, operations-and-kill-switch, security.
  Backend **561** green (17 new); frontend tsc + build clean; verified
  end-to-end in a real browser (register → validate/approve/activate an
  agent → create/publish a version → deploy → run an execution to
  `SUCCEEDED`).

#### Part 5.0 hardening — closing the acceptance-criteria gaps

A follow-up pass against the SRS's acceptance criteria and Definition of
Done, closing every item that was only partially met:

- **Runtime limits fully enforced** (§46-§48): `maximum_executions_per_minute`
  and `maximum_cost` (rolling daily budget) join the already-enforced
  `maximum_concurrent_executions`; `maximum_tokens` is checked pre-flight
  against an estimate of the input alone. Every count excludes the
  execution being evaluated (it's already flushed when the check runs) —
  without that exclusion, a request always counted against its own limit.
- **Execution timeout** (§36): `maximum_execution_seconds` now actually
  bounds the model call (`ThreadPoolExecutor` + `future.result(timeout=)`,
  not `signal.alarm`, so it works cross-platform); exhausting retries after
  a timeout reports `TIMED_OUT`, not a generic `DEAD_LETTERED`.
- **Worker crash recovery** (§32): `ExecutionWorkerService.reap_expired_locks`
  finds any `execution_locks` row past its `expires_at` (a worker that
  claimed an execution and never finished), applies the normal retry
  policy to the execution it was guarding, and drops the stale lock —
  called opportunistically before every claim, plus a
  `POST /runtime/workers/reap` endpoint for operator-triggered recovery.
- **Tool constraints enforced** (§23): `read_only`,
  `maximum_calls_per_execution` and `allowed_domains` are now real checks
  in the Tool Gateway, not just stored JSONB.
- **Kill switch PROJECT and PLATFORM scopes** (§60): PROJECT resolves
  every agent under a project in the actor's org; PLATFORM is cross-tenant
  and additionally requires the actor's role to be `SUPER_ADMIN` — a
  permission scoped to one organization must never be enough, alone, to
  halt every organization's executions.
- **Input/output contract validation** (§7.2): execution input is
  validated against the agent definition's `input_schema` before an
  execution row is even created (`jsonschema`, new dependency); output is
  validated against `output_schema` before an attempt is allowed to report
  `SUCCEEDED`.
- **Execution state machine, actually validated** (§27): every
  `AgentExecution.status` assignment goes through one guarded helper
  (`_set_execution_status` / `_EXECUTION_TRANSITIONS`) that rejects any
  transition not in the documented machine, instead of trusting each call
  site to only ever assign a legal value.
- 16 new backend tests (577 total green) covering all of the above,
  including two genuine bugs the new tests caught and fixed: an off-by-one
  in the per-minute rate limit (a request counted against its own limit
  before being decided) and a test-isolation leak where a manually
  reaped-and-requeued execution could be claimed by an unrelated later
  test ahead of its own (the global, non-tenant-scoped claim query is
  correct production behavior — see
  [docs/runtime/workers-and-queue.md](docs/runtime/workers-and-queue.md) —
  but requires tests not to leave orphaned `QUEUED` rows behind).

Next: production readiness (MFA, OAuth/SSO, observability).

## Future (Phase 4+)

Retiring the legacy `/auth/login` surface (now the platform's only non-revocable
credential), MFA, OAuth/SSO, enterprise IdPs, Slack/webhook notifications,
observability (Prometheus / OpenTelemetry), anomaly detection, and load testing.
